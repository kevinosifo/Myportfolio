			<p>I grew up in Dublin, i have lived in dublin my whole life. I was living in crumlin when i was young then after a few years i moved area because of racism and now i live in lucan, lucan is a very good area and i have met very nice people.It is not the best place to live but i still enjoy living here as it is better than crumlin by far.
